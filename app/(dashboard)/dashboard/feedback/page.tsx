//todo: theres no feedback model, so what you do is fetch the form with getUser forms then map through and display it in cards and also display the title and when the form was created then if you click the title it takes you to that og form page with the table I am yet to redesign.

const FeedbackPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>FeedbackPage</div>
  )
}

export default FeedbackPage
